Program for text cryptography. Remake of my old Cryptos program which was writed on Delphi.

# Features
- Switching alphabets on the go
- Supports custom alphabets
- Saving all characters and letter case
- Load/save text to file

## Supported ciphers
- Litorea (UKR)
- Caesar (UKR/EN, switch on go)
- XOR (any language)
- A1Z26 (UKR/EN, switch on go only for encrypting)
- Vigener (UKR/EN, switch on go)
- Atbash (UKR/EN, switch on go)

Also all ciphers support custom alphabets (except litorea).
